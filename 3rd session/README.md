Easy Programming Language
Concise Code
Dynamically Typed

BBC Fun Show
'The complete Monty Python's circus'

Java===>OOPs
C=>Procedure/Functional oriented
Perl and Shell Scripting===>Scripting Language

Python==> All Rounder
Python has more topics to learn.than other languages and also more opportunities than other languages.
<!-- Compiler and interpreter -->
Sir, is Python going to replace SHELL Scripting? or they both have different roles?

**Java is facing lot of problems due to it doesn't have procedure oriented Programming language**
OOP not best fit for every problem
**But Every Program have Advantages and Disadvantages**
